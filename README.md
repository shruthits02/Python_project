# Python web scraping project using IMDB

Scraping IMDb's top 20 movies list, the goal is to extract information about the top-rated movies, including their titles, release years, and ratings. IMDb is a popular online database of movies, TV shows, and celebrities, and it provides a list of the top-rated movies based on user and critic reviews. Web scraping allows you to automate the process of collecting this data instead of manually copying and pasting it.
